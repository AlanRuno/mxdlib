### 💎 Blockchain & Consensus
- Advanced Rapid Stake Consensus (RSC) with Validation Chain Protocol
- Sequential validation by ≥50% of Rapid Table nodes with cryptographic signatures
- Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization for precise timing
- RocksDB persistence for high-performance UTXO and blockchain storage
- Transaction management with UTXO model and voluntary tip system
- Memory pool for transaction staging
- P2P networking with DHT-based discovery and tamper-proof routing
- Eco-friendly design with minimal energy consumption
### Validation Chain Protocol rules
- A block is valid only if it has signatures from at least 50% of Rapid Table validators
- Each signature is over: block_hash || previous_validator_id || timestamp
- Timestamp drift allowance: ±60 seconds
- One signature per validator per block height
- Relay only if you just signed the block, or the block has ≥3 valid, ordered signatures
- Fork resolution preference: more valid signatures, then cumulative latency Σ(1/latency_i), then stake weight


### 📜 Smart Contracts & Extensions
- WebAssembly (WASM) runtime using wasm3
- Contract deployment and execution
- Gas metering and limits
- State management and validation
- Secure storage with Merkle trees

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs` directory:
- [Module Documentation](docs/MODULES.md)
- [Build Instructions](docs/BUILD.md)
- [Integration Guide](docs/INTEGRATION.md)
- [MXD Whitepaper (English)](https://mxd.com.mx/WhitePaper_En.pdf)

The library's architecture is designed for optimal performance and security in cryptocurrency operations, with a focus on rapid transaction processing and network efficiency. Our modular design separates concerns into distinct components:

### 📦 Module Organization
- **Crypto Module**: Implements hashing (SHA-512, RIPEMD-160) and signing operations
- **Address Management**: Handles wallet address generation and validation
- **Blockchain Core**: Manages consensus mechanism and block validation
- **Transaction Processing**: Implements UTXO model with voluntary tip system
- **P2P Networking**: Handles node discovery and communication
- **Smart Contracts**: Manages WASM-based contract execution
- **Checkpoints**: Provides blockchain synchronization points
- **Data Quantization**: Optimizes data storage and transmission

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### ✅ PRODUCTION STATUS (August 2025)
**SECURITY**: Critical security vulnerabilities resolved through comprehensive audit and implementation of secure logging framework and environment-based secrets management.

**CURRENT STATUS**: 85% Production Ready
- ✅ Core cryptographic and blockchain functionality implemented
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities addressed and verified
- ✅ Basic infrastructure and monitoring operational
- 🔄 Enterprise compliance and advanced monitoring in progress

**PERFORMANCE**: Current validated capacity of 10 TPS with enterprise target of 100 TPS
**NETWORK**: 3-second maximum latency (enterprise target: <1 second)

**See**: `docs/planning/NEXT_STEPS_POST_AUDIT.md` for complete enterprise readiness roadmap

### 🔒 Security Development Guidelines
If you are contributing to this project:

1. **Use secure logging framework** - MXD_LOG_* macros implemented in `src/mxd_logging.c`
2. **Environment-based secrets** - Load from environment variables, never hardcode
3. **Input validation required** - Use existing validation framework for all inputs
4. **Follow security patterns** - Review implemented security measures in codebase

### Node Configuration
The node can be started with or without a configuration file:
```bash
# Start with custom config
./mxd_node custom_config.json

# Start with default config
./mxd_node
```
The default configuration file (`default_config.json`) is automatically loaded from the same directory as the executable if no configuration file is specified.

### 🔐 Cryptographic Implementation Status:
- **Hybrid System**: Both Ed25519 and Dilithium5 supported simultaneously on the same network
- **Default Algorithm**: Ed25519 signatures via libsodium (production ready)
- **Post-Quantum**: Dilithium5 signatures available (requires `-DMXD_PQC_DILITHIUM=ON` at build time)
- **Runtime Selection**: Nodes can use different algorithms; `algo_id` field identifies which algorithm each address uses
- **Wire Protocol**: Self-describing messages include `algo_id` and length fields for variable-size keys/signatures
- **Address Derivation**: `HASH160(algo_id || pubkey)` prevents cross-algorithm address collisions
- **API**: Unified `mxd_sig_*` functions dispatch to appropriate backend based on `algo_id`
- **Breaking Change**: Address format changed in v2 protocol; requires coordinated network reset

### Prerequisites

⚠️ **Important**: Before proceeding with any build or test operations, you must first install all dependencies:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh [--force_build]
```

This step is mandatory and ensures all required libraries and tools are properly configured.

The script automatically detects your operating system and runs the appropriate installation script:
- Linux: Uses apt-get and builds from source
- macOS: Uses Homebrew and builds from source (supports both Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Windows: Uses MSYS2/MinGW and builds from source

Options:
- `--force_build`: Force rebuild and installation of libraries even if they are already installed

These scripts will automatically install:

## 💡 Basic Usage

### Generate MXD Address
```c
#include <mxd_address.h>

// Generate Ed25519 keypair (default)
uint8_t algo_id = MXD_SIGALG_ED25519;
uint8_t public_key[MXD_PUBKEY_MAX_LEN];
uint8_t private_key[MXD_PRIVKEY_MAX_LEN];
mxd_sig_keygen(algo_id, public_key, private_key);

// Derive address (includes algo_id to prevent collisions)
uint8_t address[20];
size_t pubkey_len = mxd_sig_pubkey_len(algo_id);
mxd_derive_address(algo_id, public_key, pubkey_len, address);

// Generate Base58Check address string
char address_str[42];
mxd_generate_address(public_key, address_str, sizeof(address_str));
```

### Create Transaction
```c
#include <mxd_transaction.h>

mxd_transaction_t tx;
mxd_create_transaction(&tx);
mxd_add_tx_output(&tx, recipient_key, 1.0);
