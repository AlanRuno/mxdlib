## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

⚠️ **Important**: Before proceeding with any build or test operations, you must first install all dependencies:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh [--force_build]
```

This step is mandatory and ensures all required libraries and tools are properly configured.

The script automatically detects your operating system and runs the appropriate installation script:
- Linux: Uses apt-get and builds from source
- macOS: Uses Homebrew and builds from source (supports both Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Windows: Uses MSYS2/MinGW and builds from source

Options:
- `--force_build`: Force rebuild and installation of libraries even if they are already installed

These scripts will automatically install:
#### System Dependencies
- build-essential (Ubuntu/Debian)
- cmake
- libssl-dev
- libsodium-dev
- libgmp-dev

#### Required Libraries
- wasm3 (WebAssembly Runtime)
- libuv (Event-driven Library)
- uvwasi (WASI Implementation)

The script supports both Ubuntu/Debian and macOS systems.

For manual installation instructions, see below:

#### System Dependencies (Manual Installation)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libssl-dev libsodium-dev libgmp-dev

# macOS
brew install cmake openssl libsodium gmp
```

#### Required Libraries (Manual Installation)
The following libraries need to be built and installed:

1. wasm3 (WebAssembly Runtime):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3
cd wasm3 && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_WASM3_LIBS=ON ..
make && sudo make install
```

2. libuv (Event-driven Library):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/libuv/libuv
cd libuv && mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

3. uvwasi (WASI Implementation):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nodejs/uvwasi
cd uvwasi && mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

After installing all dependencies, update the library cache:
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```

### Build Steps
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/AlanRuno/mxdlib.git
cd mxdlib

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make

# Run tests (requires completed dependency installation)
make test
```

### 🧪 Testing Information
The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for all core modules
- Integration tests for blockchain operations
- Performance tests for cryptographic operations
- Network simulation tests for consensus mechanism
- Smart contract execution tests

Expected test duration: 3-5 minutes on standard hardware
Memory requirement: Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
Note: Some tests require network connectivity for P2P simulations

## 💡 Basic Usage

### Generate MXD Address
```c
#include <mxd_address.h>

char address[42];
uint8_t public_key[256];
mxd_generate_address(public_key, address, sizeof(address));
```

### Create Transaction
```c
#include <mxd_transaction.h>

mxd_transaction_t tx;
mxd_create_transaction(&tx);
mxd_add_tx_output(&tx, recipient_key, 1.0);
mxd_sign_tx_input(&tx, 0, private_key);
```

### Deploy Smart Contract
```c
#include <mxd_smart_contracts.h>

mxd_contract_state_t state;
mxd_deploy_contract(wasm_code, wasm_size, &state);
```
